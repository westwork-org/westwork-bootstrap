A Note on Alice
---
Many online services refer to the people who engage with their service as "users," a term that reduces people to simple consumers. At the same time, referring to a Westwork owner as a "person" is awkward and abstract. The solution we adopt is to refer to the hypothetical person owning and using the Westwork device as "Alice" from here forward.

Design
---
Westwork's design aims to be inviting, easy to use, personable, but efficient, and somewhat subdued. Less "playful" than Google, but with more humor than Microsoft.

Colors
---
Westwork's colors tend toward a light grey and purple pastel palatte. One example of such a palatte is [here](http://paletton.com/palette.php?uid=54H0u0k4Qw00nUV25Ir8urzd5ng) but others are of course possible.

Alice's Choice
---
While many self-hosting projects aim to give Alice maximum flexibility and options, Westwork takes a different approach. Alice shouldn't be forced to think about which services are available, which she wants to run, and how they work together. The system should just work, the various services should be integrated with one another, and have a coherent user interface. 

Federation
---
Westwork should interoperate with other Westwork instances through open protocols. It should default to using preexisting protocols where they are available and workable, but we should not hesitate to blaze new trails and bring our work to standards bodies to codify them.
