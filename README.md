Westwork Client
====
This repository is the React client side code that will form the frontend for the Westwork system.

During bootstrap it will present the questions given by the backend system and return the answers given by Alice.
During normal operation it will provide a coherent user interface to Alice, pulling in data from the backend as needed.
